# Summary
Since there is no significant difference in % terms of the vine and non-vine reviews, we cannot positively conclude elements of bias in the Vine program. While the non-vine reviews are 46%, the vine reviews are not too far behind at 42% of the total count. 

We have looked at the count and percentage of the count in performing this analysis. Alternatively, we could use any of the central tendency measures (mean, median) to conduct this analysis. This would give us a clear picture of any outliners in the data set. Then we could determine the average rating for vine and non-vine reviews. 

Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
